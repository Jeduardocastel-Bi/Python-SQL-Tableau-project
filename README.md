# 🍉 A/B Test: Online International Store

## 📖 Project Description  
You have been tasked with analyzing an A/B test conducted by an international online store. The previous analysts started the experiment but abandoned it mid-project (to start a watermelon farm in Brazil). They left behind only the technical specifications and the expected test outcomes.  

### Technical Description:  
- **Test Name**: `recommender_system_test`  
- **Groups**: A (control), B (new payment funnel)  
- **Launch Date**: 2020-12-07  
- **Cutoff Date for New Users**: 2020-12-21  
- **End Date**: 2021-01-01  
- **Audience**: 15% of new users from the EU region  
- **Purpose**: Test the impact of an improved recommendation system  
- **Expected Outcome**:  
  - Within 14 days of registration, users in the test group should show improved conversion rates across these events:  
    - **Product Page Views** (`product_page`)  
    - **Adding Items to Cart** (`product_card`)  
    - **Purchases** (`purchase`)  
  - A minimum of **10% increase** at each stage of the funnel (`product_page → product_card → purchase`).  
- **Target Participants**: 6,000
